            <p>
                The average person born and raised in the United States completes
                more than twelve years of formal education with confidence in their
                ability to read, write, and comprehend English. Many move forward
                believing they can communicate effectively in both school and work.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, as adults, many Americans discover that proper English feels
                like a second language. Writing clearly, professionally, and with
                confidence becomes increasingly difficult over time.
            </p>

            <h3>Learning English Stopped in the Sixth Grade</h3>

            <p>
                For most people, formal English instruction largely ends by sixth
                grade. Beyond that point, writing and comprehension are taught with
                the assumption that foundational skills were already mastered.
            </p>

            <p>
                When those skills were never fully learned or were forgotten, there
                was often no opportunity to catch up. Many adults unknowingly use
                fragmented or incorrect English throughout their lives.
            </p>

            <h3>ChatGPT as an English Assistant</h3>

            <p>
                Since its public release on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT has provided
                users with a tool that does more than write full essays or emails.
                It helps improve tone, structure, clarity, and intent.
            </p>

            <p>
                By acting as an assistant rather than a replacement, ChatGPT allows
                users to correct mistakes caused by forgotten English training and
                communicate more professionally and confidently.
            </p>

            <h3>Not Just a Spell Check</h3>

            <p>
                While commonly viewed as a writing tool, ChatGPT can also assist
                with translating documents, brainstorming ideas, analyzing data,
                coding, and supporting creative projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                For many adults, ChatGPT has become an everyday assistant that helps
                bridge communication gaps and strengthen written expression.
