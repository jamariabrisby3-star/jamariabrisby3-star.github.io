                A trip to the hospital causes anxiety for many patients. This anxiety
                does not come solely from the patient’s health condition, but from
                uncertainty about what questions to ask and how to ask them. Many
                patients fear forgetting important information such as test results,
                prescriptions, or follow-up instructions.

            <p>
                This fear is multiplied when patients must translate medical
                information for children, elderly family members, or loved ones.
                The medical experience can quickly become overwhelming.

            <h3>Living in the Old Medical World</h3>

            <p>
                In the past, patients entered doctor’s offices with little knowledge

                Appointments often involved medical professionals speaking while
                patients listened quietly, unsure how to ask questions. Afterward,
                patients left with complicated terminology, unanswered concerns,
                and handwritten notes that were difficult to understand.

            <h3>Connecting the Medical World</h3>

            <p>
                Health information was once scattered across multiple facilities and
                disconnected applications. On January 7, 2026, OpenAI launched
                ChatGPT Health, a HIPAA-compliant tool designed to help patients
                securely access and understand their medical records.

                ChatGPT Health provides personalized insights rather than diagnosis
                or treatment, allowing patients to ask questions, analyze records,
                and collaborate more effectively with healthcar
